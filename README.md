# Email-Spam-Detection

Email Spam Detection Machine Learning Project
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on building a model to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham).

Project Overview
The growing volume of email spam poses a significant challenge for users and organizations. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying spam emails based on their content and metadata.

Technologies Used
Python (programming language)
scikit-learn (machine learning library)
NumPy (numerical computing library)
Pandas (data analysis library)
[Optional: Additional libraries based on your implementation, e.g., TensorFlow, Keras]
Data
The specific dataset used for training and testing the model will be documented here. Include details like source, format, and any pre-processing steps applied.
Models Explored
This section will list the machine learning algorithms you considered for building the spam detection model. Briefly describe each algorithm and the rationale for choosing them.
Model Performance Evaluation
Explain the metrics used to evaluate the performance of your model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Report the achieved performance metrics on the test set.

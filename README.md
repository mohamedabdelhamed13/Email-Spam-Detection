# Email-Spam-Detection

Email Spam Detection Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on building a model to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham).

## Project Overview
The growing volume of email spam poses a significant challenge for users and organizations. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying spam emails based on their content and metadata.

## Data
Sourse : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/email-spam-detection-dataset-classification


## Models Explored
This pipeline first converts email text into numerical features based on word counts.
Then, it uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether an email is spam or not.

Additional Notes:

Pipelines improve code organization and reusability.
This code snippet sets up the pipeline, but doesn't train or use it for predictions yet.
